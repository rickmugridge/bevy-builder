# bevy-builder
A UI-based builder for Bevy

This is in the very early stages of development.

It consists of two main parts:
 * Builder pattern based builders for Button, TextField, etc
 * A UI builder for creating and customising Buttons, etc visually - we just handle a little of Button at this stage

Part of the reason to build this is to get more familiar with bevy.
