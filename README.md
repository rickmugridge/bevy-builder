# bevy-builder
A UI-based builder for Bevy

This is in the very early stages of development.

It consists of two main parts:
 * Builders for Button, TextField, etc based on the builder pattern.
 * A UI builder for creating and customising Buttons, etc visually. We just handle some of Button at this stage

Part of the reason to build this is to get more familiar with bevy.
